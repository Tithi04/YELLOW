Required metric for tracking at Launch:
App Load Time.
Install Rate.
Retention Rate.
North Star Metric- Daily Active Users.
Session Length.
Reasons for tracking such metrics are:
App load time:
This metric should be at the top of the list if you want to deliver the best experience to your users.

Today, users want their app user experience to be smooth and fast, and if your app takes too much time to load, then they’ll not think twice about uninstalling it.

Ideally, your app load time should be 2 seconds. According to a report by Google, you should aim for under 3 seconds to display content to users.

Install Rate:
Install rate measures the percentage of app store visitors who actually install your app. This allows you to measure both the effectiveness of your app marketing strategies in getting users to your listing and the effectiveness of your app store optimization (ASO) strategies.

Retention Rate:
Not everyone will actively use your app, but some users will find value in your app and revisit it frequently. This is where the retention rate comes into play. To make this clearer, let’s say you have: 1,000 users at the beginning of the third quarter 1,500 at the end of the third quarter Of these 1,500, there are 800 new users So in this case, We can say here that you have a 70% quarterly retention rate. Depending on the business you’re in, you need to calculate retention rates over a realistic timeline.

Daily Active Users-
DAU is the most important metric for tracking the number of users who actively open or engage your app on a daily basis. There’s no formula to calculate it, just the number of unique users who used your app on a specific day. It’s understandable that not all apps need to be opened every day, so depending on your business, you can track weekly active users (WAU), monthly active users (MAU) or average daily active users (ADAU).

Session Length:
Session length is the engagement metric that measures the average amount of time a single user spends within your app. In other words, you see how long your app is able to deliver value to your users.

Product Analytics
